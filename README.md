# Lua Type Error Example

This repository demonstrates a common type-related error in Lua.  Lua's dynamic typing system allows for flexibility but can also lead to runtime errors if not handled carefully.  This example shows a function that attempts to add 1 to a variable that may be a string, resulting in an error.

The `bug.lua` file contains the buggy code, and `bugSolution.lua` provides a corrected version with error handling.
